Easy, performant syslog for Clojure, exposed as a [manifold][manifold]
stream. Supports [RFC 3164][RFC3164] (classic BSD syslog), and the
[RFC5424][RFC5424] compliant [RFC 5426][RFC5426] (syslog over UDP) and
[RFC 6587][RFC6587] (syslog over TCP and TLS) specifications.

Since all of this is exposed using the stream abstractions from
[manifold][manifold], it works well with a variety of synchronous and
asynchronous programs, including [`core.async`][coreasync].

## Motivation

A couple of reasons you might want this:

- By having the API be a stream, your code becomes much easier to test. No
  need to set up a real syslog server; just see what comes out the other end.
- You can also use Clojure-like shorthand for severities, facilities and the
  like, for example, you can use `:info` (short for `:informational`, the name
  used in the spec, which also works) or even `"INFO"` instead of having to
  remember that that's severity 6.
- You can log strings or structured messages; they'll be serialized
  appropriately regardless.
- Breadth of different specs and transports (UDP, TCP, TLS) supported.
